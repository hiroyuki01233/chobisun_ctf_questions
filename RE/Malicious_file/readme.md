Title: Patch Me If You Can


Hey, check out this annoying program I found! It just spams the screen with some weird art. The author must think they're clever, hiding a flag in here somewhere.
I took a quick look. The code is a mess, and I have a feeling it might even modify itself at runtime.
To get the flag, you'll probably have to find a hidden key and manually slot it into the right place in memory while the program is running. Think you can handle it? Good luck!
