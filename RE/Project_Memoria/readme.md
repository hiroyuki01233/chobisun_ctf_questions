Project Hakoniwa

(HAKONIWA is a Japanese term for a "box garden," representing a small, self-contained, and perfect world, which fits the theme of a beautiful cage.)

Description
You've stumbled upon an old, abandoned program: "Project Hakoniwa". Upon execution, you find yourself communicating with Aoi, a girl whose consciousness has been transferred into a beautiful but unchanging digital world she calls the "Garden."

Her "Papa" placed her here, but his motives are unclear. Was this digital core built to be her eternal prison, or was it a final, desperate fortress to protect her from a fate worse than death? The system is unstable, wracked by "noise" that threatens to tear Aoi's memories apart.

Your choices will determine her trust, and only by gaining it can you access the system's core. To stabilize it, you must reverse engineer the very machine that runs this world, decipher its hidden language, and execute the final command. Can you navigate the noise, understand the father's true intentions, and bring peace to the lonely soul trapped in the code?

Hint 1
Aoi is lost in a sea of sorrow and suspicion. The system responds to your empathy. To piece together the key, you must first choose words of hope and trust over words of despair and doubt. Her heart is the first lock.

Hint 2
The father didn't just build a garden; he built his own machine to run it. The core logic doesn't execute on your CPU's native instructions. Before you can understand the what (the password, the time limit), you must first reverse engineer the how. Analyze the "engine" that powers this digital world to understand its unique language.
